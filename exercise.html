<article class="mart">
		<h3 style="color:black;">Kamps</h3>
<p>Kamps is my favorite place to workout in Madison. It consists of treadmill work and floor/bench work. Each day of the week is a new theme. My favorite and the hardest day is leg day which is on Mondays. The instructors are so ecouraging and it is so much fun!</p>

	<h3 style= "color: black;">Turnstyle</h3>
	<p>Turnstyle is another one of my favorites in Madison. The workouts consist of a 45 minute spin class. Turnstyle is especially known for its themed classes based on the style or artist of the music that will be played. My favorite music theme was the Broadway one.</p>
