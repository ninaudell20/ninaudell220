	<h2>Where I like to do Homework and Study</h2>
	<h3 style= "font-size: 200%; color:hotpink;">Classes</h3>
	<p>Because I am majoring in <strong>Finance at the Wisconsin School of Business</strong> my classes are mostly business oriented. I have taken a variety of introductory courses such as Marketing 300, MHR 300, OTM 300 and Accounting 100. I am currently taking my first finance course, Finance 300. I am also taking two courses that count towards a digital studies certificate: LIS 351 and Marketing 355.</p> 
	<h3 style= "font-size: 200%; color:purple;">Study</h3>
	<p> There are many places around Madison where I like to study. I can never foucs while doing work in my room, so if I want to stay close I go to the study room in my building. If I want to get out, I love going to the third floor of the library in Grainger. I also like going to the lobby of the Graduate or Starbucks.</p> 
	<h3 style= "font-size: 200%; color:blueviolet;">Academic Groups</h3>
	<p> I am a part of three academic groups on campus: Phi Gamma Nu a professional development organization, WIFA women in finance and accounitng, and The Women's Network. I love networking and have met so many new people.</p>
